# Installation Guide

This document explains how to install and run **Password Creator with Forum** locally.

## 🧰 Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
- No backend or database required — it's a static frontend project

## 📦 Steps

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lxfx05/Password.git
cd Password
```

Alternatively, download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

*2. Open the app*

You can open any of the following HTML files directly in your browser:

- `index.html` — homepage
- `Analyzer.html` — password strength analyzer
- `Generator.html` — password generator
- `Forum.html` — user input-based password creation
- `Boxe.html` — password comparison interface

Make sure `Wayland.css` is in the same folder as the HTML files.
