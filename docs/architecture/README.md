This document outlines the structural design of **Password Creator with Forum**.

## ðŸ§± Overview

The project is a static frontend application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is modular, with each HTML file serving a distinct purpose.

## ðŸ§© Components

### 1. `index.html`
- Landing page
- Navigation hub for all modules

### 2. `Generator.html`
- Password generation logic
- Six levels of complexity
- JavaScript-driven entropy and randomness

### 3. `Analyzer.html`
- Password strength evaluation
- Visual feedback (color bars, score)
- Suggestions for improvement

### 4. `Forum.html`
- Collects user input (e.g. name, birth year)
- Generates personalized passwords
- Uses form data to influence output

### 5. `Boxe.html`
- Compares two passwords
- Displays strength side-by-side
- Highlights differences in entropy and structure

### 6. `Wayland.css`
- Custom styling framework
- Dark mode, blur effects, responsive layout
- Shared across all HTML files

## ðŸ§  Logic Flow

- User interacts with UI â†’ triggers JS functions
- JS processes input â†’ generates or analyzes password
- Output is rendered dynamically in the DOM

## ðŸ“¦ Hosting

- Static deployment via Vercel
- No backend or database required
