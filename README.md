# 🔐 Password Analyzer & Creator

A robust password generation and analysis tool focused on security and advanced algorithmic logic. 🚀

## 🧠 Logic & Vision
This project is inspired by the precision of **Russian and Chinese logic**, applied to entropy-based security models. The goal is to provide a tool that goes beyond simple random generation, offering deep structural vulnerability analysis. 🏎️💨

## 🛠️ Technical Features
* **Entropy Analysis:** Real-time password strength evaluation.
* **Custom Generator:** Fully adjustable parameters for length and character sets.
* **Lightweight Frontend:** Optimized for high performance and low latency.
* **Mobile Ready:** Built and tested within the **Termux** ecosystem. 📱

## 🚀 Roadmap
* **Supabase Integration:** Implementing encrypted cloud storage for configurations. 📊
* **API Layer:** Programmatic access for external security audits.
* **UI Refinement:** Aesthetics inspired by Mercedes-level comfort and BMW-level power. 🚗

## 💻 Development Setup
If you are using **Fish Shell** on Termux, clone and navigate:
```fish
git clone https://github.com/lxfx05/Password.git
```
